        <h3>The Reality</h3>
        <p class='content'>
          New managers are often promoted based primarily upon technical competence. It is generally assumed they will learn critical management skills naturally in the course of their activities.
        </p>
        <p class='content'>
          In truth, management and leadership do not come naturally to most people and the transition can be inordinately stressful (for all concerned) without effective preparation. New managers are generally hesitant to speak openly about their knowledge gaps. They often internalize their stress, double down on ineffective techniques, and are met with pushback instead of progress. They may soon begin to wonder why they ever agreed to become a manager.
        </p>
        <h3> Compounding the Reality </h3>
        <p class="content">
          Most organizations don&#39;t offer comprehensive management training to their newly promoted leaders. But even when they do, it may not be enough to ensure a smooth transition.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Traditional management and leadership training programs can be great for imparting information and creating a baseline understanding of responsibilities. Many leaders and managers, however, find it challenging to integrate principles learned in training into their own personal style. Others think they are integrating the principles perfectly, only to find that feedback suggests otherwise. Humans are complicated. We generally have good intentions, but donâ€™t always clearly see the impact of our actions.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          When valued contributors find leadership responsibilities frustrating, training is probably not enough. Individualized coaching can provide new perspectives which can in turn inspire new patterns of thought and behavior. Leading can then become more rewarding for the leader and more productive for the organization.
